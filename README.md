## BrouserRouters
    We use in project is using React Router v6's createBrowserRouter and RouterProvider for client-side routing.
## How it works in your code: 
    You define routes using createBrowserRouter, mapping each path (like /, /AboutUs, /Services, etc.) to a React component.
    RouterProvider is used in your App component to enable routing throughout the app.
    This setup allows navigation between pages (Home, AboutUs, Services, OurProjects, Contact) without reloading the page.
